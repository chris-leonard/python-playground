    "**Definition:** Let $\\left(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, P\\right)$ be a probability space and $\\left( S, \\Sigma\\right)$ be a measurable space. A *random variable*, or more precisely a *$\\left( S, \\Sigma\\right)$-valued random variable* is a $\\left(\\mathcal{F}, \\Sigma\\right)$-measurable function $X:\\Omega\\to S$.\n",

    "**Notation:** If $A\\in\\Sigma$ is a measureable set then we define\n",

    "If $A=\\{a\\}$ then we will write $P\\left(X=a\\right)$ in place of $P\\left( X\\in A\\right)$. Finally, if $A=(-\\infty, b]$ (or its intersection with $S$) we write $P\\left( X\\leq b\\right)$ in place of $P\\left( X\\in A\\right)$. This extends to other inequalities in the obvious way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "1. Let $S$ be a countable set and $\\Sigma=\\mathcal{P}(S)$, or equivalently let $\\Sigma$ be the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{B}(S)$ of $S$ where $S$ is endowed with the discrete topology (all sets are both open and closed). Since $\\Sigma$ is generated (as a $\\sigma$-algebra) by all singletons, a function $X:\\Omega\\to S$ is a random variable if and only if $P\\left(X=a\\right)$ is well-defined for all $a\\in S$. If so, we call $X$ a *discrete random variable*. Particularly important examples are $S=\\mathbb{N}$ and $S=\\mathbb{Z}$.\n",
    "2. Let $S=\\mathbb{R}$ with its usual topology and set $\\Sigma=\\mathcal{B}\\left(\\mathbb{R}\\right)$. A function $X:\\Omega\\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a random variable if and only $P(X\\leq b)$ is well-defined for all $b\\in\\mathbb{R}$ (or $P(a<X<b)$ is well-defined for all $a, b\\in\\mathbb{R}$, etc.). If so, we call $X$ a *real-valued random variable*, or simply a *real random variable*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that since singletons are closed in $\\mathcal{B}\\left(\\mathbb{R}\\right)$, if $S$ is a countable subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ then the two examples coincide. In this case we might call $X$ a *discrete real-valued random variable*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convention:** With real random variables the sample and event spaces are almost incidental and we often describe real-valued random variables solely in terms of the probability measure $P$, without any reference to $\\Omega$ and $\\mathcal{F}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "1. Consider a single coin flip with a probability $p$ of coming up heads and define a probability space $\\left(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, P\\right)$ as before. Define a discrete real random variable $X$ by $X(H)=1$ and $X(T)=0$. Then $P\\left(X=1\\right)=p$ and $P\\left(X=1\\right)=1-p$.\n",
    "2. Suppose you flip the coin above 10 times in a row. Let $\\Omega$ denote the set of 10 letter words in the alphabet $\\lbrace H, T\\rbrace$, $\\mathcal{F}=\\mathcal{P}\\left(\\Omega\\right)$, and let $P$ determined by $P(H)=p$ and $P(T)=1-p$ in the obvious way. Suppose you are betting on the outcome of the coin flips: you win £1 for every head and lose £2 for every tail. Let $X$ be the discrete real random variable that represents you winnings at the end of the game. So, for example, $P(X=-20)=(1-p)^{10}$."
